  <h1>Lesson Plan</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

  <h3>What is debugging?</h3>
  <p>Not just finding bugs. Specifically, finding them by using tools that let you <b>watch your code as it runs</b> and <b>manually control it line-by-line</b>. These tools are called <b>debuggers</b>.</p>
  <p>Advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>See the state (value) of your variables at particular times during your program.</li>
    <li>Pause your program at a particular place or on a particular error.</li>
    <li>Run an expression or statement in the paused program to try things out.</li>
    <li>(Web/javascript) Inspect and manipulate HTML and CSS elements.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Opening the debugger. Keyboard shortcuts. Display to right / left / separate window. Console tab, executing expressions. Sources tab. Tree of sources.</p>
  <p>Setting breakpoints. For <code>setup()</code>, you have to reload the page. Stepping through code. "Step into" vs "step over" vs "step out". "Resume" runs until next breakpoint. Call stack. Managing breakpoints - don't forget to remove them when you're done! How to disable some / all breakpoints.</p>
  <p>Looking at variable state. Different scopes of variables. Executing expressions while paused. Esc to open/close console. Watch expressions.</p>
